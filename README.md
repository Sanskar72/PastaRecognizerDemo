# PastaRecognizerDemo
Trial YOLO model to recognize if pasta is penne or spaghetti from input image using darknet and labelImg.
images.zip conatins the YOLO annotated dataset for penne or spaghetti for 70ish images each.
the jupyter notebook is inspired by the notebook provided by eMasterClass Academy
The notebook provided by them is a bit buggy and hence Ive debugged the code and it runs perfectly.
