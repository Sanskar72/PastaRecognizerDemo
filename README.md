# PastaRecognizerDemo
--> Trial YOLO model to recognize if pasta is penne or spaghetti from input image using darknet and labelImg.\n
images.zip conatins the YOLO annotated dataset for penne or spaghetti for 70ish images each.
The notebook provided by them is a bit buggy and hence Ive debugged the code and it runs perfectly.
PastaDetection.py is used to preprocess the test images, predict label and make rectangular boxes around the prediction.
test1, test2, test3, test4 image files show that the model works properly with a very high accuracy!
The jupyter notebook and python file is inspired by the notebook provided by eMasterClass Academy.
